Fixes GUI and HUD translucency support in Minecraft, allowing resource packs like <a href="https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/aquahud">AquaHUD</a> to work properly. Requires [Architectury API](https://modrinth.com/mod/architectury-api).

### Compatibility?
>Should be compatible with anything, really. Maybe another mod that has a drawTexturedQuad mixin might conflict, but I've never seen it. Even works with [Exordium](https://modrinth.com/mod/exordium) and [ImmediatelyFast](https://modrinth.com/mod/immediatelyfast), both of which also affect GUI related things.

### Requirements?
>Requires [Architectury API](https://modrinth.com/mod/architectury-api) for all versions 2.0.0-beta and above. Additionally, [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) is required for the "Fabric & Quilt" 2.0.0-beta and above versions of this mod.
